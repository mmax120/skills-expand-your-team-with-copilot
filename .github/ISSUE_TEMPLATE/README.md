## How to Use

1. Click the "New Issue" button in the GitHub repository

## Tips for Writing Good Issues

- **Be specific**: Instead of "make it prettier", say "change the main color from blue to lime green"
- **Explain why**: Help us understand the reasoning behind the request
- **Include examples**: Screenshots, links, or mockups are very helpful
- **One issue per request**: Don't combine multiple unrelated requests in a single issue

## Questions?

If you have a general question or want to discuss something that doesn't fit these templates, you can start a discussion or create a blank issue.
